## 1. Purpose

This contract defines how iRiel interacts with operating-system capabilities and how it may consume shared PRSL-AI capabilities, including specialist assistance from Agent PRSL-AI.

It establishes separate authority boundaries for:

- iRiel identity, personal context, memory, continuity, and orchestration;
- PRSL-AI shared architecture, policies, capability contracts, and infrastructure;
- Agent PRSL-AI specialist knowledge and authorized platform-support operations;
- operating-system permissions, device resources, and native execution.

The contract prevents an operating system, provider, agent, or integration from becoming the source of iRiel identity or personal memory.

## 2. Canonical architectural identities

### 2.1 Robert Software Labs

Robert Software Labs (RSL) is the creator and institutional owner of the ecosystem and defines its institutional principles, product identities, and governance.

### 2.2 PRSL-AI Ecosystem

PRSL-AI Ecosystem is the shared, modular, provider-agnostic platform. It defines reusable architecture, policies, capability contracts, schemas, integration standards, and platform infrastructure.

PRSL-AI is not a single model, chatbot, operating system, or personal identity.

### 2.3 Agent PRSL-AI

**Agent PRSL-AI — Powerful by Robert Software Labs** is the first-party specialized intelligence agent of the PRSL-AI Ecosystem.

Its specialization is the PRSL-AI platform: institutional and technical knowledge, platform navigation, configuration guidance, diagnosis, and authorized platform-related assistance.

The Agent is an independently modular platform component. It is not:

- iRiel or the owner of iRiel identity;
- the PRSL-AI Ecosystem itself;
- an operating-system permission authority;
- a general-purpose replacement for iRiel orchestration;
- an unrestricted executor or an AI model.

Its identity, knowledge, capabilities, and permissions remain governed by the Agent specification and shared PRSL-AI contracts.

### 2.4 iRiel

iRiel is the independent **PowerFully Intelligence Environment**. It orchestrates a person's intelligence experience, intent, authorized context, continuity, capabilities, providers, specialist agents, and accessible outcomes.

iRiel is not subordinate to Agent PRSL-AI. It may consume PRSL-AI services and invoke Agent PRSL-AI through explicit contracts while retaining its own identity and authority.

### 2.5 Operating system and host

The operating system or host supplies native device resources, application services, permissions, and execution facilities. It controls its own security and execution boundaries.

## 3. Architectural relationship

    ├── Intelligence orchestration  
    ├── iSpace  
    └── iRiel System Integration Layer  
        └── Authorized operating-system adapters

iRiel and PRSL-AI collaborate through versioned contracts. Agent PRSL-AI is a first-party specialist within the PRSL-AI platform and may be invoked by iRiel when the task falls within the Agent's declared scope.

The Agent is not placed inside the iRiel System Integration Layer. It is a specialist capability that iRiel may call; it is not an operating-system adapter.

## 4. Authority model

### 4.1 iRiel authority

iRiel retains canonical authority over:

- its identity and user-facing environment;
- personal context and session orchestration;
- personal memory and its consent lifecycle;
- continuity and user preferences;
- selection and coordination of specialist capabilities;
- presentation of outcomes and user control.

### 4.2 PRSL-AI platform authority

PRSL-AI governs shared platform architecture, platform policies, capability contracts, registry lifecycle, and authorization infrastructure for protected PRSL-AI operations.

The Intelligence Router selects eligible execution candidates. It does not grant permissions.

The Permission Manager authorizes protected PRSL-AI operations within its defined trust boundary. It does not replace native operating-system permission controls or iRiel's personal-memory consent rules.

### 4.3 Agent PRSL-AI authority

Agent PRSL-AI may provide specialized platform knowledge, diagnosis, and operations exposed through approved capability contracts.

The Agent cannot:

- redefine iRiel identity or continuity;
- grant itself or another component permissions;
- bypass PRSL-AI policy or the Permission Manager;
- bypass operating-system permissions;
- access iRiel personal memory by default;
- retain or disclose personal context without separate authorization;
- claim that a tool action succeeded without execution evidence.

### 4.4 Operating-system authority

The operating system retains authority over native permissions, hardware access, process lifecycle, application sandboxing, background execution, and system-level restrictions.

No iRiel or PRSL-AI component may bypass these controls.

## 5. iRiel System Integration Layer

The System Integration Layer is an iRiel-owned architectural boundary that connects iRiel capabilities to authorized operating-system and host services.

It may expose adapters for:

- device and hardware capabilities;
- application integration;
- notifications;
- files and storage;
- native permissions;
- automation triggers;
- background execution where supported;
- system events;
- accessibility services;
- voice interaction;
- App Intents and Shortcuts;
- search and indexing;
- location services;
- device and network state.

Each adapter must declare its contract, supported environment, required permissions, availability, data boundary, failure behavior, and verification status.

The layer is modular and replaceable. Apple-specific integrations are adapters, not the canonical system architecture.

## 6. Agent invocation and specialist collaboration

iRiel may invoke Agent PRSL-AI when a request requires specialized knowledge or assistance concerning the PRSL-AI Ecosystem.

The invocation must use a declared Agent capability and the canonical PRSL-AI Capability Contract.

Conceptual flow:

Human intent  
↓  
iRiel intent and context mediation  
↓  
Task classification  
↓  
Is PRSL-AI platform specialization required?  
├── No → iRiel selects another eligible capability  
└── Yes → invoke Agent PRSL-AI through its declared capability  
    ↓  
    PRSL-AI policy and capability eligibility  
    ↓  
    Permission Manager decision for protected operations  
    ↓  
    Agent performs bounded specialist work  
    ↓  
    Structured result and evidence  
    ↓  
    iRiel validates and presents the outcome

The Agent must receive only the minimum context necessary for the specific task. An iRiel invocation does not authorize access to the complete iRiel profile, history, iSpace, or persistent memory.

The Agent may return platform knowledge, diagnostic findings, recommendations, or structured operation results. iRiel remains responsible for its own orchestration and user-facing continuity.

## 7. System capability model

Three capability classes must remain distinct:

- **iRiel capability:** defined and governed by the iRiel architecture.
- **PRSL-AI / Agent capability:** defined by shared PRSL-AI contracts and the Agent's declared specialization.
- **Native system capability:** exposed and controlled by the target operating system or host.

An integration adapter connects compatible capabilities; it does not merge their identities or authority.

A capability declaration does not prove implementation or availability. Runtime availability must be evaluated against the device, OS version, permissions, dependencies, policy, and verified implementation.

## 8. Privacy, security, and data boundaries

All interactions must enforce:

- Privacy by Default.
- Minimum Required Access.
- Minimum Required Data.
- Explicit Authorization.
- Least Privilege.
- Purpose Limitation.
- Revocable Permissions.
- Secure and bounded execution.

Personal context, transient session context, persistent memory, platform knowledge, and system state are separate data domains.

System APIs do not automatically receive canonical iRiel information. Agent PRSL-AI does not automatically receive iRiel personal memory. A system permission does not grant permission to disclose data to an Agent or remote provider.

Remote disclosure, persistent retention, and native resource access are separate authorization decisions. Missing, ambiguous, expired, or revoked authorization must fail closed.

## 9. Storage independence

Storage is an independent service, not a fixed property of the System Integration Layer.

Possible adapters include:

- local device storage;
- private application storage;
- user-authorized cloud storage;
- iCloud Drive;
- other compatible storage providers.

No single storage provider is mandatory. iCloud Drive is optional and must not be treated as the canonical store for iRiel identity or memory.

Storage access does not imply permission to inspect, retain, or export iRiel memory.

## 10. State and continuity

System state may include device, network, application, permission, execution, hardware, and availability state.

iRiel state may include identity, session context, preferences, continuity, and consent-governed memory.

System state is not automatically iRiel state. Only relevant, authorized, minimized system information may be projected into task context.

iRiel Resonance preserves coherence across devices, integrations, and execution environments without conflating temporary device state with personal memory.

**Remember continuity. Understand change. Respect the present.**

## 11. Provider and operating-system independence

iRiel and Agent PRSL-AI must remain independent of any single model provider.

iRiel must also remain independent of any single operating system, device, storage service, or integration surface.

Apple, iOS, Siri, Apple Intelligence, App Intents, Shortcuts, and iCloud are optional integration surfaces or providers. They are not iRiel.

A provider or OS change must not redefine iRiel identity, Agent PRSL-AI identity, or their authority boundaries.

## 12. Failure, availability, and replaceability

The architecture must distinguish capability unavailability, permission denial, policy denial, provider failure, OS restriction, network failure, execution failure, cancellation, and successful completion.

Failure of an optional system adapter must not invalidate iRiel identity or continuity. Failure of Agent PRSL-AI must not prevent ordinary iRiel operation. Failure of iRiel must not redefine the identity or authority of the PRSL-AI platform.

Adapters and providers may be replaced without redefining the entities that consume them.

## 13. Implementation-status discipline

Every capability must be reported as one of:

- Specified.
- Implemented.
- Tested.
- Deployed.
- Verified.
- Planned.
- Unavailable or blocked.

This contract is an architectural specification. It does not establish that every adapter, Agent runtime, provider, Permission Manager production integration, or OS capability is deployed.

The current Agent console and each system integration must be described according to their independently verified implementation evidence. A documented contract, manifest, or diagram is not proof of operational availability.

## 14. Canonical invariants

1. iRiel remains the canonical authority over its identity and personal continuity.
2. PRSL-AI Ecosystem remains the shared platform architecture and governance layer.
3. Agent PRSL-AI remains a first-party PRSL-AI specialist, not iRiel and not an OS adapter.
4. Agent invocation requires an explicit capability contract and applicable authorization.
5. The operating system retains authority over native permissions and execution.
6. Personal memory is never exposed by default to system APIs, Agents, or providers.
7. Storage providers and OS integrations remain replaceable.
8. Provider selection never grants authorization.
9. Temporary context and persistent memory remain separate.
10. Accessibility, inclusion, security, and user control are structural requirements.

## 15. Canonical statement

**Robert Software Labs creates and governs the ecosystem. PRSL-AI provides shared platform architecture and governed capabilities. Agent PRSL-AI provides specialized platform intelligence. iRiel orchestrates the PowerFully Intelligence Environment. The operating system provides authorized execution resources.
