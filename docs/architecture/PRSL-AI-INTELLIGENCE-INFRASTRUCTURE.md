# PRSL-AI Intelligence Infrastructure
## Architecture Foundation, Component Taxonomy, and Integration Principles

**Status:** Architecture definition  
**Implementation status:** Not yet implemented as a complete infrastructure  
**Owner:** Robert Software Labs  
**Platform:** PRSL-AI Ecosystem

---

## 1. Purpose

PRSL-AI Intelligence Infrastructure is the shared, expandable technological foundation through which the PRSL-AI Ecosystem can develop, publish, govern, execute, and integrate specialized capabilities.

It is not a single API, framework, application, or model. It is an organized system of interoperable building blocks, including APIs, frameworks, extensions, SDKs, engines, runtimes, schemas, intents, entities, connectors, and orchestration services.

The infrastructure must support iRiel and other authorized applications without making any application dependent on a single implementation, model, vendor, or execution environment.

This document defines the architectural foundation. It does not claim that the listed components or services already exist or are operational.

## 2. Architectural Principles

1. **Modularity:** Every component has a defined responsibility and an independently managed lifecycle.
2. **Interoperability:** Components communicate through documented, versioned contracts.
3. **Provider agnosticism:** Models, vendors, and infrastructure providers are replaceable behind stable interfaces.
4. **Privacy by default:** Data access is minimized, purpose-bound, and governed by explicit authorization.
5. **Execution flexibility:** Capabilities may run locally, on platform-controlled infrastructure, or through an explicitly approved external provider.
6. **Independent evolution:** Components can be upgraded, replaced, disabled, or deprecated without requiring a redesign of the entire ecosystem.
7. **Honest capability status:** Proposed, experimental, tested, and operational capabilities must never be represented as equivalent.
8. **Human control:** Authorization, user intent, and applicable policy constrain execution.

## 3. Infrastructure Taxonomy

The infrastructure may contain the following component types. The taxonomy is extensible.

### 3.1 APIs
Stable interfaces that expose operations and capabilities to authorized consumers. APIs define endpoints or operation interfaces, request and response contracts, authentication requirements, errors, versioning, and service-level expectations.

### 3.2 Frameworks
Reusable foundations, libraries, conventions, and runtime abstractions used to build, compose, test, and maintain services and capabilities.

### 3.3 Extensions
Optional modules that add capabilities to an existing application, environment, workflow, or platform without requiring a full rebuild.

### 3.4 SDKs
Developer-facing libraries and typed clients that simplify secure and consistent consumption of PRSL-AI APIs and services.

### 3.5 Engines
Specialized processing mechanisms, including inference, recognition, retrieval, transformation, reasoning, and media-processing engines. An engine is an implementation mechanism, not necessarily a public API.

### 3.6 Runtimes
Controlled execution environments for local, on-device, self-hosted, or platform-hosted components.

### 3.7 Connectors and Adapters
Integration components that translate between external systems, providers, protocols, and PRSL-AI contracts. Provider-specific details must remain behind adapters.

### 3.8 Orchestration Services
Services that discover, route, sequence, and coordinate authorized capabilities. Routing decisions must respect intent, context, policy, permissions, availability, and execution constraints.

### 3.9 Schemas
Machine-readable definitions of data structures and contracts. Schemas govern inputs, outputs, events, configuration, errors, and shared domain objects. They must be versioned and validated.

### 3.10 Intents
Normalized representations of a requested goal or operation. Intents help translate user or application requests into capability-independent tasks. An intent is not itself an execution permission; policy and authorization checks remain mandatory.

### 3.11 Entities
Typed representations of domain concepts and objects exchanged across the ecosystem. Entities must have clear identity, meaning, relationships, provenance where relevant, and privacy classifications where applicable.

### 3.12 Developer and Governance Tools
Tooling for documentation, testing, validation, observability, security review, compatibility checks, lifecycle management, and controlled publication.

## 4. Specialized Intelligence Domains

The initial catalog may include, but is not limited to, the following domains:

- Vision Intelligence
- Voice Intelligence
- Location Intelligence
- Recognizers Intelligence
- Tools Intelligence
- Alternative Tools Intelligence
- Creative Intelligence
- Reader Intelligence
- Language Intelligence
- Knowledge Intelligence
- Accessibility Intelligence
- Security Intelligence

Each domain may contain multiple independent components. A domain is a classification and coordination boundary, not a requirement to build one oversized service.

Examples of possible capabilities include image understanding, OCR, speech recognition, speech synthesis, transcription, translation, document extraction, semantic analysis, geocoding, navigation context, entity recognition, accessibility adaptation, and tool discovery. These are candidate capabilities, not declarations of implementation.

## 5. Component Boundaries

Components should be independently deployable when operational needs justify it, but independent deployment is not mandatory from the beginning.

The initial implementation may use a modular monolith or shared application infrastructure, provided that internal boundaries, contracts, ownership, and dependencies are explicit. Components can later be separated into services when scale, security isolation, availability, or operational requirements justify the additional complexity.

Do not create a separate server, database, or deployment pipeline for every capability by default.

## 6. Common Component Contract

Every registered component should define, where applicable:

- Stable component identifier and canonical name
- Component type and intelligence domain
- Purpose, scope, and explicit non-goals
- Owner and maintainers
- Version and compatibility policy
- Lifecycle status
- Input and output schemas
- API or invocation interface
- Required permissions and data classifications
- Dependencies and supported integrations
- Execution mode and runtime requirements
- Error model and retry behavior
- Health and readiness checks
- Logging and observability requirements
- Security considerations
- Documentation and test references

Components must not expose secrets, private credentials, or unnecessary user data through their interfaces or logs.

## 7. Component Registry and Discovery

A centralized registry should provide a reliable source of metadata for infrastructure components.

The registry should support:

- Registration and unique identifiers
- Component type and domain classification
- Search, filtering, and discovery
- Version and compatibility metadata
- Dependencies and relationships
- Lifecycle and availability status
- Documentation and schema references
- Permission and execution requirements

Registry metadata must distinguish descriptive declarations from verified operational health. A registered component is not automatically an available or functioning service.

## 8. Lifecycle Management

Use a consistent lifecycle vocabulary:

1. **Proposed** — identified but not yet designed in sufficient detail.
2. **Designed** — architecture and contracts are documented.
3. **In Development** — implementation is underway.
4. **Available for Testing** — a testable implementation exists.
5. **Operational** — implementation, security, and operational checks have been completed.
6. **Deprecated** — still identifiable but scheduled for replacement or retirement.
7. **Archived** — no longer available for active use.

Status transitions should be evidence-based. Do not mark a capability Operational merely because its interface, mock, or documentation exists.

## 9. Integration and Communication

Prefer API-first, contract-first integration.

The infrastructure should support, where appropriate:

- REST and JSON interfaces
- Event-based communication where asynchronous workflows are needed
- Versioned contracts and endpoints
- Standardized errors
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limits and resource controls
- Health and readiness checks
- Observability and audit events
- Idempotency and safe retry semantics where relevant

Protocol selection must follow the capability's needs. Do not force every component into the same transport if another documented interface is more appropriate.

## 10. Security, Privacy, and Governance

All components must follow:

- Least-privilege access
- Explicit authorization and purpose limitation
- Secure secret management
- Separation of user, application, and service identities
- Data minimization and retention controls
- Auditable access and execution
- Input validation and output handling
- Protection against unauthorized tool execution
- Clear trust boundaries for external providers
- Local execution options where technically supported

Local, platform-hosted, and external execution must be distinguishable. External providers must not receive data by default merely because an integration exists.

## 11. Relationship with iRiel and Other Consumers

The infrastructure is shared ecosystem capability, not an iRiel-only subsystem.

Potential authorized consumers include:

- **iRiel:** [PowerFully Intelligence Environment](./IRIEL-POWERFULLY-INTELLIGENCE-ENVIRONMENT.md) and personal intelligence orchestration.
- **iApps:** Applications within the ecosystem.
- **Agent PRSL-AI:** Institutional platform intelligence, within its defined scope.
- **Approved external integrations:** Other systems explicitly authorized to consume published capabilities.

iRiel remains responsible for personal intelligence orchestration and user-facing continuity. See the [canonical iRiel technical definition](./IRIEL-POWERFULLY-INTELLIGENCE-ENVIRONMENT.md). The infrastructure supplies reusable capabilities; it does not replace iRiel's identity, context, policy, or orchestration responsibilities.

Preserve this architectural principle:

> The model thinks. The agent executes a specialty. The Router decides. iRiel orchestrates.

The infrastructure must not make iRiel a monolith or force it to depend on one model or provider.

## 12. Initial Platform Work

The platform should progressively provide:

1. Infrastructure overview and architecture documentation.
2. Component registry and discovery interface.
3. Intelligence domain catalog.
4. Component detail records and lifecycle status.
5. Contract and schema documentation.
6. Integration and developer documentation.
7. Security and governance documentation.
8. Validation and operational evidence.

If backend services are not yet available, implement only the truthful foundations: metadata, documentation, registry structures, schemas, and clearly labeled lifecycle states. Do not create mock endpoints and present them as operational APIs.

## 13. Implementation Sequence

Recommended sequence:

1. Inspect the existing PRSL-AI platform architecture and reuse established conventions.
2. Define the component metadata model and registry.
3. Define common schemas, identifiers, versioning, and lifecycle rules.
4. Define intent and entity conventions.
5. Establish API and extension contracts.
6. Establish framework and SDK conventions.
7. Implement the first narrowly scoped capability as a reference implementation.
8. Add validation, security, observability, and compatibility checks.
9. Expand the catalog incrementally.
10. Integrate with iRiel only through explicit, documented contracts and authorization.

This sequence is a recommendation, not a claim that the work has already been completed.

## 14. Implementation Constraints

- Preserve the existing PRSL-AI platform and its institutional identity.
- Inspect before modifying; avoid duplicate systems and unnecessary dependencies.
- Do not rebuild the platform.
- Do not invent operational services or fabricated health states.
- Do not expose secrets in frontend code.
- Do not connect iRiel prematurely.
- Do not modify DNS, domains, email records, or external hosting configuration.
- Do not initiate Cloudflare deployment or configuration.
- Report completed, partially completed, planned, and blocked work separately.

## 15. Intelligence Router contract

The [PRSL-AI Intelligence Router Contract](./PRSL-AI-INTELLIGENCE-ROUTER-CONTRACT.md) defines the routing component's candidate-selection responsibility and its boundaries with iRiel orchestration, platform policy, the Permission Manager, the Capability Registry, providers, and execution runtimes. The Router selects only eligible candidates; it does not grant permissions or own personal context and memory. Its production runtime and provider selection must be verified independently.

## 16. iRiel Intelligence Server contract

The [iRiel Intelligence Server Contract](./IRIEL-INTELLIGENCE-SERVER-CONTRACT.md) defines a replaceable service and integration boundary for authorized clients. It composes existing platform responsibilities rather than duplicating them: authentication/admission at the service boundary, policy and Permission Manager decisions at their designated authorities, candidate selection through the Intelligence Router, and protected action enforcement at the trusted execution boundary. The Server does not own canonical iRiel identity, memory, or Resonance.

## 17. Governing Principle

PRSL-AI Intelligence Infrastructure is an expandable foundation for creating, governing, executing, and integrating specialized technological capabilities.

Build shared foundations once. Keep responsibilities small and explicit. Expand the catalog continuously. Preserve the independence of every service and application.

**The infrastructure provides capabilities. The contracts make them interoperable. Governance makes them trustworthy. Applications use them without surrendering their independence.**
